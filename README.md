## Introduction
This project is a simplified clone of **Splitwise**, designed to help users manage group expenses efficiently. It allows users to create groups, add expenses, track balances, and visualize financial data.  

## Step 1: Creating User and Group Models
- The `User` class (found in `users.py`) stores a user's **name, email, and balance**. It includes methods to retrieve and update the balance.  
- The `Group` class (found in `groups.py`) manages a group's **name, members, and expenses**.  

## Step 2: Basic GUI
- We implemented a **basic graphical user interface (GUI)** in this step.  
- The interface will be improved and refined in later stages.  

## Step 3: Graph Visualization
- We created a **graphical representation** of group expenses using **Matplotlib**.  
- This feature helps users visualize financial distributions and understand spending patterns.  

## Step 4: Database Setup
- An **SQLite database** was set up to manage users, groups, expenses, and debts.  
- This database ensures **data persistence**, enables **historical analysis**, and improves **efficiency** in handling relationships and transactions.  

## Final Integration
- The **frontend and backend** were successfully integrated to provide a smooth user experience.  
- This was the **most time-consuming step** in the project!  

## Bug Fixes
- Some small bugs were identified and fixed.  
- The corrected version is available in the **"Correction"** branch.
