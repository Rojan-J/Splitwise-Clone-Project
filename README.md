- In groups,py we have a Group class containing the name of a group, its members and expences whithin each group.

## Step 2: Basic GUI
In this step, we create a basic GUI, but it will change in the following steps.

## Step 3: Graph
Initially, we created a simple graph based on the groups we have, which can be visualized using Matplotlib.

## Step 4: Database Setup
In this step, we created a SQLite database to manage users, groups, expenses, and debts. This database stores and saves data for history, analysis, and efficient handling of relationships and transactions.
